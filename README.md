# Make Windows Usable Scripts

These scripts aim to take away a lot of the repetitive tasks that are required in order to make a new Windows 10 installation usable. Currently it installs a basic set of software via the chocolatey package manager. More will be added in the future.

While this script is especially useful on a new installation of Windows 10 it can also be used on an existing installation. All scripts can be run multiple times as well. 

This based on the steps I go through when setting up a new Windows 10 installation and thus is very opinionated. 

## Why does this exist

A lot of times I get asked by members of my family and friends for help with their Windows PC. In some cases I also set up new devices for them or reinstall the operating system. I noticed that I keep installing the same programs and changing the same default settings. This script schould do all that for me in the future. 

I will be expanding and changing this script in the future as I am discovering new useful software and settings. 

It took me years to finally take the time to create this, I am sure it will save me quite some time in the future. I am sharing this so that it will hopefully also save some other peope time.

## How to contribute

I do not use this scripts on a daily basis, if anything breaks reporting this in an Issue on GitHub helps a lot.

Pull requests are very welcome. It might be helpful to discuss improvements in an Issue beforehand. As mentioned before, I consider this project to be very opinionated, thus I will not merge any changes that I belevive do not fit in. You can always still create your own scripts based on my work.

Also forgive my lacking PowerShell and Windows knowledge, I am just a Tech-Guy who regularly helps family and frinds with their Windows PCs, not a Windows expert by any means.
